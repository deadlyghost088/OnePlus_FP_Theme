# DeadlyGhost Fingerprint Theme Substratum
A substratum theme([Template](https://github.com/substratum/template)) created for OnePlus 6T (fajita) to change fingerprint animation themes.

### Guide for overlay files:
Every change is located under *assets>overlays*
Overlays include changes to:
1. Fingerprint Icon
2. Fingerprint Animation Frames
3. Dash Charging Animation / Warp Charging Animation (only McLaren 6T)

To provide an option to choose fingerprint icons along with fingerprint animations, each separately, type2 and type3 formats had to be used to incorporate both overlays into the theme. Fingerprint Icons are of type2_xx while everything else(animation frames) is placed under type3_yy.

A thread dedicated to this theme can be found here: [DeadlyGhost FP Theme - XDA](http://bit.ly/2VXPRdd)
